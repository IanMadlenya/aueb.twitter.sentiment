# aueb.twitter.sentiment

This repository contains the system which participated in SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter(http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/) and specifically the Message Polarity Classification subtask. The system was ranked 5th among 34 teams(http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/data/uploads/semeval2016_task4_results.pdf). Our approach is a weighted ensemble of two systems.

The basic functionality of the program is to detect the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a message.
